            <p>Nanjing is a popular city full of Chinese history and old traditional southern kinds of agriculture. As a northern people from China, Nanjing was the first city that I traveled to the region south of the Yangtze River. Confucius Temple - Qinhuai River is the most famous place to show the beauty of Nanjing.</p>
            
            <p>Confucius temple has many traditional temple agricultures inside and many small shops about traditional Nanjing specialties and popular restaurants. There are also many colorful traditional lanterns which made the night of qinhuai more gorgeous. People can also take the “Hua Fang” ( a special kind of ship) to travel around the river and the whole scenery.  </p>

            <p>Barcelona, is a beautiful city on the Northeastern coast of Spain that is the byproduct of a rich and artistic history with modern infrastructure. One of the main attractions of the city is its gorgeous architecture, often the work of world renowned architects such as Antoni Gaudi. Some of the most notable works are the modern Basilica of La Sagrada Familia, and the tranquil and eloquent Park Güell.</p>
            <p>Much of Barcelona’s charm comes down to local culture, from diverse culinary offerings, to the sunny vacation-ridden atmosphere of the beaches, and even the symbolism of nationalism and independence that Barcelona residents display. The passion of the locals is unwavering, including in famous soccer matches by one of the sports greatest clubs: F.C. Barcelona, and in numerous local artistry events. It is no wonder why many travelers to Spain feel rejuvenated and fortunate enough to have experienced the city’s irresistibly strong culture and atmosphere.</p>
